# Oscilliscope-Automation
For capturing data from Keysight oscilliscope and saving to text file.


Test_Script: Saves function 1 data

Test_Script_2Ch: Same as Test_Script but saves function 1 and 2

Test_Script and Test_Script_2Ch save data to function1 and function2 text files

Peak_finder: Detects peak frequency within a certain bandwidth, records data to ROC (Ring Oscillator) and Time text files. Requires Oscilliscope  setup information

Plotter uses ROC and Time to plot data with a specifiedmoving average interval

frequency_plotter gives a "snapshot" of the oscilliscope screen
